## Absolute Centroid Location of Submarine Earthquakes from 3D Waveform Modeling of Water Reverberations

In this paper, we present a novel approach for retrieving precise centroid locations of submarine earthquakes that is based on the modeling of water phases in teleseismic records. Read more about it [here](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JB018941).
