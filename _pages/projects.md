# Overview
The primary focus of my research is to gain greater understanding of the material properties of the Earth across different scales. To do so, I use both earthquake and ambient noise recordings to characterize the way that different type of seismic waves propagate through the interior of the planet and behave in different tectonic settings. With sets of observations as such, I am able to construct high-resolution images of the velocity structure of volcanic and subduction systems that allows us to piece together their geologic history and evolution. Another important aspect of my research involves the use of computational tools to perform numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation to extract more information about the earthquake rupture process.
