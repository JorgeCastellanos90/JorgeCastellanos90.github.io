# Overview
Through my research, I aim to gain a better understanding of the material properties of the Earth across different scales. To do so, I use both earthquake and ambient noise recordings to characterize the way that different seismic waves propagate and amplify in different tectonic settings. With this type of observations, I am able to construct high-resolution images of the seismic structure of volcanic and subduction systems that allows us to stitch together the tectonic history and evolution of the 

the availability of modern computational tools, I corroborate and

Most of the constraints that I am able to place on this come from analyzing the way that seismic waves propagate through the Earth, I am able to place critical constraints I am also able to create high-resolution images of the seismic structure of volcanic and subduction systems that allows to recreate the tectonic history and evolution of large provinces. Another important aspect of my research involves the detailed analysis of the propagation properties of earthquake seismic waves
