# Overview
The primary focus of my research is to gain greater understanding of the material properties of the Earth across different scales. To do so, I use both earthquake and ambient noise recordings to characterize the way that different type of seismic waves propagate through the interior of the planet and behave in different tectonic settings. With such sets of observations, I am able to construct high-resolution images of the velocity structure of volcanic and subduction systems that allows us to piece together their geologic history and evolution. Another important aspect of my research involves the use of computational methods to perform numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation to extract more information about the earthquake rupture process.

## Wavefield Imaging
Over the past few decades, ambient noise interferometry has become an essential tool to image and monitor the Earth's interior. This method goes beyond the spatial limitations of classical earthquake seismology uses the Earth's background vibrations recorded at a pair of seismic stations to reconstruct the Green's function between the two stations. The practicality of this technique allows us to extract complete seismic wavefields without the involvement of tectonic earthquakes which, in turn, enable us to investigate the geo-mechanical properties of any region at unprecedented resolutions. In my research, I use this type of analysis to characterize the wave propagation properties of the shallow crust of metropolitan areas, which is of utmost importance to predict ground motion and asses the seismic hazard.

## Geologic Puzzles & Mantle Dynamics
An important and popular branch of geophysics is the study of the physical processes that underlie tectonic deformation. Understanding of the mechanics behind these processes require the assimilation and interpretation of different observables that span the fields of geochemistry, geodesy and seismology. In my research, I use classical seismological methods to prove the Earth's inner structure create high resolution images of tectonically enigmatic regions. With these images, I am able to infer plausible scenarios that can explain
