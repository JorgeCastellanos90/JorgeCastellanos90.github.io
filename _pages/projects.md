# Overview
The primary focus of my research is to gain greater understanding of the material properties of the Earth across different scales. To do so, I use both earthquake and ambient noise recordings to characterize the way that different type of seismic waves propagate through the interior of the planet and behave in different tectonic settings. With sets of observations as such, I am able to construct high-resolution images of the velocity structure of volcanic and subduction systems that allows us to piece together their geologic history and evolution. Another important aspect of my research involves the use of computational methods to perform numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation to extract more information about the earthquake rupture process.

## Wavefield Imaging
Over the past few decades, ambient noise interferometry has become an essential tool to image and monitor the Earth's interior. This method goes beyond the spatial limitations of classical earthquake seismology uses the Earth's background vibrations recorded at a pair of seismic stations to reconstruct the Green's function between the two stations. Both the robustness and flexibility of this technique allows us to extract complete seismic wavefields without the involvement of tectonic earthquakes which, in turn, enable us to investigate the geo-mechanical properties of any region at unprecedented resolutions. I use this type of analysis to characterize the wave propagation properties of the shallow crust of highly populated regions. These type of analysis are imperative to predict ground motion and, thus, earthquake hazard assessment.
