<p style="text-align:justify;">I am a Ph.D. candidate in Geophysics at Caltech's Seismological Laboratory in Pasadena, California. My research focuses on using a wide variety of both classical and modern seismological tools to characterize the Earth's multi-scale structure and quantify its wave propagation properties. Some of my main interests include elastic wavefield imaging, tomographic reconstructions, seismic interferiometry, full-waveform inversion and ground motion prediction.</p>

  description: "We walk, and not just to get around. We feel lonely, and we still want to be left alone. We know we are all different, but we can't help envying others. We say we don't care, but uncaring remarks sting us for long. We love to work, and yet we need our rest. We are moved by music and visual arts and photographs and words, and not just for their literal or sensory content, but for the symbols within and the emotions they provoke. We are rational, silly, ambitious, lazy, logical, absurd, reasonable, stubborn, grown-up and childish, all at once. We are only human!"
