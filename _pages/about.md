## About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Geophysics at Caltech's Seismological Laboratory in Pasadena, California. My research focuses on using a wide variety of both classical and modern seismological tools to characterize the Earth's multi-scale structure and quantify its wave propagation properties. Some of my main interests include elastic wavefield imaging, tomographic reconstructions, seismic interferiometry, full-waveform inversion and ground motion prediction.
