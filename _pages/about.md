## About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Geophysics at Caltech's Seismological Laboratory in Pasadena, California. My research focuses on using a wide variety of both classical and modern seismological tools to characterize the Earth's multi-scale structure and quantify its wave propagation properties. Some of my main interests include elastic wavefield imaging, tomographic reconstructions, seismic interferiometry, full-waveform inversion and ground motion prediction.

     border: 3px solid #0f0;
     overflow:auto; // without overflow here, if the "Line 1" and "Line 2" is short then "Next elements" will display below "Line 2" and the image will cover the "Next elements" 
}
